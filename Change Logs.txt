							AresDEV

[Information]
AresDEV is a public project started by me, Caezer.
I am not really good with MapleStory development, nor Java.
But I want to learn.

[Revision 1]
+ Based off MoopleDEV Revision 120
+ Project->Source->Format & Project->Source->Clean Up...
+ Tweaked Script Engine for Java 8 ( Credits: http://forum.ragezone.com/f427/tweaking-script-engine-java-8-a-1008662/ )
+ Implemented NX format ( Not working as of yet, some minor bugs. Credits: http://forum.ragezone.com/f427/moopledev-rev120-nx-patch-937004/ )
- Removed MoopleDEV's INI usage
+ Kinda "fucked up" Moople's multi world. Using an enum in ServerConstants for now to load the worlds. ( Bad coding )
